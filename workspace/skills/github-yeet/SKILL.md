# GitHub Publish (commit, push, open PR)

Local git does branch, stage, commit, and push through `workspace_run`. The pull request is opened with `connector_github`. The `gh` CLI is not installed. For Prometheus source changes, use `promsrc-pr-worktree` instead.

## 1. Confirm scope

```powershell
git status --short; git branch --show-current; git remote get-url origin; git log --oneline -3
```
- Read the diff of every file you intend to ship (`git diff -- <path>`).
- Unrelated or unknown changes in the tree: do not include them. If you cannot tell which files belong, ask once with `ask_prometheus_questions` (options: the file groups you found).
- Never `git add -A` or `git commit -a` in a mixed tree.

## 2. Branch

- On the default branch (`main`/`master`): create a branch named for the change, e.g. `git switch -c fix/<short-slug>`.
- Already on a feature branch: stay on it.

## 3. Validate, stage, commit

- Run the repo's relevant checks (tests, typecheck, lint, build) before committing. Report failures instead of committing broken work silently.
- `git add <explicit paths>`; `git commit -m "<imperative one-line summary>"`.

## 4. Push

`git push -u origin <branch>` and confirm with `git ls-remote origin <branch>` that the remote sha matches `git rev-parse HEAD`.

## 5. Open the PR

- Owner/repo come from the origin URL (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git` or `git@github.com:<owner>/<repo>.git`). Base: what the user named, else `api_request` `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` and use `default_branch`.
- `connector_github({action:"create_pr", owner, repo, title, head:"<branch>", base, body, draft:true})`. For a fork, `head` is `<fork-owner>:<branch>`.
- Body in real Markdown: what changed, why, user impact, root cause for fixes, and the checks you ran with results.
- Draft by default unless the user asked for a ready PR. Never merge from this skill.

## 6. Report

Branch, commit sha, PR number and URL, checks run with results, and anything left out of the PR on purpose. Then `list_check_runs` on the head sha once; if CI fails, hand off to `github-gh-fix-ci`.
